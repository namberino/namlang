# The NIMBLE Programming Language

![logo](doc/img/logo.png)

NIMBLE (Nam's Interpreted Modular Basic Language Engine) is a dynamically typed, interpreted programming language with C-like syntax. This repository contains the source code for the NIMBLE programming language's interpreter.

I started this project at the beginning of June 2024 with the goal of learning more about programming language design and practicing my C++ skills. It then gradually became one of my biggest projects yet. 

This was a gigantic learning project for me. The interpreter is not very optimized and there may be some bugs that I overlooked, but I'm quite happy with how it turned out. I'll definitely continute working on when I have the time.

## Syntax

```nimble
fun fib(n)
{
    if (n <= 1)
    {
        return n;
    }

    return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
}

var li = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 20; i = i + 1)
{
    li[i] = fib(i);
}

print(li);
```

NIMBLE is a dynamically typed programming language, featuring C-like syntax with class support and C++ inheritance syntax. It has a very "*fun*" syntax (because the function keyword is *fun*)

## Requirements

Before compilation, you'll need to have these tools installed first:
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) or [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (I built this with Clang but GCC works just fine)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Project structure

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [benchmark](benchmark/) | Benchmark programs |
| [doc](doc/) | Documentation |
| [examples](examples/) | Example programs |
| [include](include/) | Header files |
| [src](src/) | Source code |
| [tests](tests/) | Test cases |
| [tools](tools/) | Useful tools and scripts |

## Compiling

If you're using `make`:
- `make compile` to compile the program into the `bin/` directory
- `make run` to run the program
- `make clean` to clean up the object and binary files
- `make test` to run test cases
- `make bench` to run benchmarks

## Benchmark

Average elapsed time of computationally intensive programs:

| Program | AET |
| --- | :---: |
| bintree.nbl | 82s |
| count.nbl | 57s |
| fibonacci.nbl | 77s |
| prime.nbl | 35s |

## Documentation

You can find the documentation in the [doc](doc/) directory. You can also learn about the syntax of the language through example programs found in the [examples](examples/) directory.

## VSCode syntax support

I've created a VSCode extension for the language. You can checkout the extension [here](https://github.com/namberino/nimble-vscode)
